# 🛩️ Airship Zero - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Features

### 🎮 Core Architecture
- **Centralized Simulator**: `core_simulator.py` with unified game state management
- **Scene-Based UI**: Separate files for each interface (main menu, bridge, engine room, navigation)
- **320x320 Logical Resolution**: Pixel-perfect scaling with nearest-neighbor interpolation
- **Pixelify Sans Font**: Integrated retro font with proper antialiasing disabled for crispy scaling

### 🧩 Working Scenes

#### 1. Main Menu (`scene_main_menu.py`)
- New Game button properly starts simulation
- Resume Game button (enabled after starting a game)  
- Settings and Quit buttons
- Tab/keyboard navigation working

#### 2. Bridge (`scene_bridge.py`)
- Live flight instruments (altitude, airspeed, heading, RPM, manifold pressure, fuel flow)
- Battery, fuel pumps, and autopilot toggles
- Navigation mode cycling
- Artificial horizon display with pitch/roll visualization
- Navigation to Engine Room and Navigation scenes

#### 3. Engine Room (`scene_engine_room.py`)
- Real-time engine monitoring (temps, pressures, RPM)
- Interactive throttle, mixture, and propeller controls
- Engine start/stop and emergency shutdown
- Propeller feather/unfeather controls
- Visual engine schematic with status indicators

#### 4. Navigation (`scene_navigation.py`) 
- **World Map Integration**: Uses `assets/png/world-map.png`
- Live position display (latitude/longitude)
- Aircraft position marker with heading indicator
- Zoom in/out functionality
- Map panning with arrow keys
- Center on position feature

### 🔧 Simulation Systems

#### Physics & Dynamics
- Engine performance simulation (RPM, temperatures, fuel flow)
- Basic flight dynamics (airspeed, altitude, heading changes)
- Fuel consumption and tank management
- Electrical system simulation (batteries, alternator, loads)
- Environmental factors (wind, weather)

#### Autopilot Features
- Heading hold mode
- Altitude hold mode  
- Airspeed hold mode
- Automatic target following

#### Navigation
- GPS positioning system
- Ground speed calculation with wind effects
- Route following capability (framework ready)
- World map coordinate conversion

### 🎛️ Controls & Input
- **Keyboard**: Tab navigation, Enter/Space activation, ESC back
- **Mouse**: Click-to-select and activate
- **Game Controllers**: Framework ready for joystick/gamepad input
- **Coordinate Conversion**: Proper screen-to-logical coordinate mapping

## 🔄 Integration Points

### Data Flow
```
Main App → Core Simulator (single source of truth)
     ↓
All Scenes → Read from simulator.get_state()
     ↓  
User Actions → Simulator methods (set_engine_control, toggle_battery, etc.)
```

### Scene Transitions
- Main Menu → "new_game" → Bridge
- Bridge → "scene_engine_room" → Engine Room  
- Bridge → "scene_navigation" → Navigation (world map)
- ESC from any scene → Previous scene

## 🎨 Visual Style
- **Brutalist UI**: Simple rectangles, minimal styling
- **Retro Color Scheme**: Dark backgrounds, golden highlights
- **Pixel Perfect**: No antialiasing on text, crispy at all scales
- **Consistent Typography**: Pixelify Sans throughout

## 🚀 Launch Ready

The system is now fully functional with:
- Working "New Game" button that starts simulation
- Centralized simulator managing all game physics
- Multiple interactive scenes with real-time updates
- World map integration for navigation
- Proper coordinate system and input handling

**Next Steps**: Run `python main.py` to experience the full flight simulator with working controls, real-time instruments, and world map navigation!
