# üéà Airship Zero - Agentic Vibe Coder Challenge

> **Transform a comprehensive game design document into a fully playable flight simulator using AI coding agents**

## The Challenge

This repository contains a complete, meticulously detailed game design specification for a realistic airship flight simulator. Your mission: **fork this repo and use your favorite AI coding agents to bring it to life**.

Think of this as the ultimate test of agentic programming - you have:
- ‚úÖ **Complete specifications** in [`data-model.md`](data-model.md) (3,500+ lines)
- ‚úÖ **Working project structure** with `pyproject.toml` and dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Basic entry point** to get you started
- ‚úÖ **Clear architecture guidelines** for AI-friendly development

Your AI agents should be able to read the specifications and implement the entire game. How far can they get?

## Quick Start for Challengers

### 1. Fork This Repository
Click the "Fork" button above to create your own copy.

### 2. Test the Current State
```bash
# Clone your fork (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/airshipzero
cd airshipzero

# Test current functionality
uv run main.py
```

### 3. Point Your AI Agents at the Specs
The complete game design is in [`data-model.md`](data-model.md). Give this to your AI agents and see what they can build!

### 4. Alternative Testing Methods
```bash
# Direct from your fork
uv tool run --from git+https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/airshipzero airshipzero

# Or traditional installation
pip install git+https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/airshipzero
airshipzero
```

## What You're Building

A comprehensive airship flight simulator featuring:

- üõ©Ô∏è **Realistic flight dynamics** with complex systems management
- ‚ö° **Electrical systems** - Battery management, dual bus architecture, fuse replacement
- ‚õΩ **Fuel management** - Multi-tank balance system with pump controls
- üéõÔ∏è **Engine simulation** - Timing adjustment, temperature management, power curves  
- üì∑ **Photography missions** - Aerial survey and artistic challenges
- üìö **Book collection system** - In-game library with markdown content
- üë®‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è **Crew management** - Fatigue, experience, inventory systems
- üå§Ô∏è **Weather simulation** - Realistic environmental effects
- üì° **Communications** - ATC simulation with proper aviation phraseology
- üéØ **Mission system** - Structured objectives and economic progression

## The Agentic Advantage

This project is designed to be **AI-agent friendly**:

- **Data-driven architecture** - Single JSON game state
- **Function-based systems** - No complex inheritance hierarchies  
- **Clear specifications** - Every system documented in detail
- **Modular design** - Independent, testable components
- **Simple dependencies** - Just pygame, numpy, pillow, markdown

## Requirements

- **Python 3.12+**
- **UV package manager** (recommended)

### Installing UV
